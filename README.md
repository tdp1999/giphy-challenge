## FAQ

#### How long have I been coding for this project?

For 04 days. From 19/07/2023 to 22/07/2023.

#### If I had more time, what improvements could I make to this project?

- Build a complete replica of Giphy, which includes gifs, stickers, and videos. However, I'm afraid this is quite challenging due to the limited number and quality of APIs/SDKs that Giphy provides for users, and it's not regularly updated.
- Use Nx to build this project.
- Dig deeper into image optimization for the Gifs section. Slow-loading images pose a significant issue for a website like Giphy.
- Add Light / Dark mode.


#### Library used
- Angular v14
- Angular CDK / Material
- TailwindCSS
